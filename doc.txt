    program will get 5 runtime arguments(<db_path> <input_table_name> <start_date_YYYY/MM/DD> <end_date_YYYY/MM/DD> <output_directory>)
    first it will initialize the contract struct with all values set to 0
    
    then we will start a for loop iterating from start date till end date
    the we will fetch the data from the sqlite database only for the current processing date and only columns[id, Date, Time, Close, AskVolume, BidVolume  ]
    then it will start iterating on the fetched data row by row 
    and then update all the values to 1 ,
        this will make the contract struct will have single week containing all the days,
        so to tackle this iterate on the data again but now this time by adding new week in the contract struc and the setting all the values to 1
         this will help in for fully test the workflow for now
         after this we will have 2 weeks with full data in them
         also make sure that the program will update all the variables in the contract struct with 1 or and apropriate value that matches the data type of that variables
         
    then save tha final processed data(contract struct) in a parquet file in the output directory as mentioned in the runtime arguments




now your job is to initialize the project to do all this workflow
